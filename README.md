# Sim800_Kicad
This project is a hobby project (make sure you read the Readme file). The board hosts Sim800 IC that provides the GPRS capabilities to the board and added different serial protocols to provide ease of connection. Also the board has a power supply design that converts the output to 4.4V that goes to the IC.
